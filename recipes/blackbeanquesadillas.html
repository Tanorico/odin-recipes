            <li>1 15oz.can black beans ($0.49)</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen corn ($0.20)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup red onion ($0.22)</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic ($0.08)</li>
            <li>1/4 bunch fresh cilantro (about ½ cup chopped) ($0.20)</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese ($1.69)</li>
            <li>1 batch taco seasoning* ($0.67)</li>
            <li>10 flour tortillas (7-inch diameter) </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Drain the black beans and add them to a bowl along with the frozen corn (no need to thaw)</li>
            <li>Finely dice the onion, mince the garlic, and roughly chop the cilantro.</li>
            <li>Add the onion, garlic, cilantro, shredded cheddar, and taco seasoning to the bowl with the beans and corn. Stir until everything is evenly combined and coated in seasoning.</li>
            <li>Place a half cup of the filling on one side of each tortilla and fold over. Cook the quesadillas in a skillet over medium heat on each side until brown and crispy and the cheesy</li> filling has melted. Slice into triangles then serve.
            <li>To freeze the quesadillas, stack the filled and uncooked quesadillas with a piece of parchment paper between each quesadilla. Place in a freezer bag and freeze for up to three months.</li> To reheat either microwave (for a soft quesadilla) or cook in a skillet on low heat (make sure to use low heat so that the filling has time to thaw and melt before the outside burns).</li>
            
        </ol>
